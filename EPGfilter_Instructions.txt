General:

EPGimport has the option of excluding channels from the import of EPG.

This is done by copying the Service Ref to the file ignore.conf in /etc/epgimport.   
By doing so.  This channel will not have EPG imported.    

There is however a different situation where you do not want EPG imported.  
f.i. this is defined in the channels file:

<!--DK--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryHD.dk">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--DiscoveryHDShowcase-->
<!--FI--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryHD.fi">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--DiscoveryHDShowcase-->
<!--HRV--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryHDShowcase.rs">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--DiscoveryHDShowcase-->
<!--HU--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryHDShowcase.hu">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--DiscoveryHDShowcase-->
<!--NO--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryChannel.no">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--DiscoveryHDShowcase-->
<!--SE--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryHDshowcase.se">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--DiscoveryHDShowcase-->
<!--SVN--><!--0.8W--><channelid="DiscoveryHD.svn">1:0:19:1006:29:46:E080000:0:0:0:</channel><!--HDDiscoveryShovcase-->

All the same service ref, but different language EPG attached.  
You can avoid this problem not to import the files which contain this conflicting EPG.
But this is not always possible. 

This script provides a filter for excluding data from being imported by EPGimport.
It will do this by removing certain links from the rytec.channels.xml file.
f.i.:

DiscoveryHD.dk
DiscoveryHD.fi
DiscoveryHDShowcase.rs
DiscoveryHDShowcase.hu
DiscoveryHDshowcase.se
DiscoveryHD.svn

leaving only DiscoveryChannel.no in the channels file.  And thus only import data labeled by DiscoveryChannel.no

The script will write several files:

1. filtered.channels.xml
    This file contains the channel links from rytec.channels.xml minus the filtered channels
2. removed.channels.xml
    This file contains the removed channels from rytec.channels.xml, so you can check what the filter has done.
3. filtered.sources.xml - to make use of the filtered.channels.xml file
    This last file is only created when the rytec.sources.xml file is present.
    When it is not present this part is skipped.


Instructions:

Copy both EPGfiler.sh and FILTERpattern.txt to /etc/epgimport
Then give the file EPGimport.sh rights to be executed. (755)
                                                             
The script requires full bash to be installed.
If you have not installed it, install it:

opkg install bash

Also xz needs to be installed.  On OpenPLi this is standard installed.
Otherwise install it from the feed.

opkg install xz

Now open the /etc/epgimport/FILTERpattern.txt file.
I have included here some examples of patterns you can set.

f.i. .pl" this will exclude all channels which have .pl extension mentioned.
Which is stupid because you will remove all polish channels from getting EPG.  So you could simply not import the source.
But even this works.

You can also use a service ref, or part of a service ref. to exclude.

Or f.i. an EPGref:    BabyTV.pl

Just add this to FILTERpattern.txt file.
No need to say: remove all my examples.  They are just there for testing purposes.
This BabyTV.pl will remove the import of BaByTV.pl for all occurences.

A bit more restrictive would be to set the pattern to:

"BabyTV.pl">1:0:1:421D:2F44:13E:820000:0:0:0:

This will only remove BabyTV.pl in combination with this service ref.

In general.  You can add any substring from the rytec.channels.xml file.
But check the removed.channels.xml for the effect.
BTW: the script downloads the rytec.channels.xml file each time it is run.
So when you do not have rytec.channels.xml, just run the script.  A copy of rytec.channels.xml will be then in /tmp/

Several other examples are given, just to give you an idea.
 

The script also relies on the existence of rytec.sources.xml.  Make sure you have this in your /etc/epgimport/ folder.
It renames the file and creates a new sources file to make use of the filtered channels.xml file.

Once this is done, the script skips this part of the process.

In order to re-enable this, rename the rytec.sources.xml.org file back to rytec.sources.xml.
But you probably never need to do this.


As now the channels file is used from a local file, and is not downloaded anymore, you probably want to run this script regularly to update the channels file.  
This can be done with a cron job running this script again.
If you run this once a week it is probably enough.  But you can run it more often if you want. 

If you want to go back to original import files.
Rename the rytec.sources.xml.org file back to rytec.sources.xml
And delete the files with filtered in the name.
